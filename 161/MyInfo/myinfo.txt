I am taking this course because it is a required course.
I believe it is required because Java is such a fundamental programming language to learn.

I have went to vocational-technical school during my high school during my time in high school.
There I took a course in Computer Information Systems and found out I really enjoy programming
I created programs using C++, Python, and Visual Basic while I was there. 
I even dabbled a little in HTML while I was at community college.
I am excited to learn a new programming language and discover the possibilities it can create for me! 

One thing that may explain my interest in programming and computers and stuff may be my Asperger's syndrome.
People with Asperger's tend to be devoted to a singular interest, mine being computers and the like!
